/**
 * Exercise 4 - Greeting Component
 * 
 * For this exercise we must implement a component
 * 
 * This component must have a text input for the name that will be used in a greeting service
 * This component must also have a call service button that will execute the greeting service
 * This component must also have a label to place the greeting service response
 * 
 * Acceptance tests 
 * 
 * Given a name placed at the text input when we execute the call service button then it should replace the content of the label with the service return
 * Given an empty name at the text input when we execute the call service button then it should replace the content of the label with the service return
 * 
 * Predicted Completion time - 25m
